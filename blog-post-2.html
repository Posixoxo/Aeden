            <p>You know that one friend who’s constantly posting about being the captain of their ship? The kind who talks about “walking away from anything that doesn’t serve their higher purpose,” as if they’re auditioning for a TED Talk nobody asked for? Yeah. We all know one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s talk about them. Or... us? (It’s fine, we’re self-aware now.)</p>
            <p>
                "I’m not afraid to be alone."
                Translation: I ghosted everyone because they dared to suggest I might not be perfect. Look, Susan, you didn't walk away; people just got tired of your 45-minute monologues about how you're "vibrating at a higher frequency now."</p>
            <p>
                "I only keep people who energize me."
                A noble goal, until you realize it’s a fancy way of saying, “I unfollowed my grandma because she posted a meme with a Minion in it.” The truth is, if everyone around you is draining, maybe you are the common denominator. Just saying.</p>
            <p>
                "I’m not interested in being liked, I’m interested in being respected."
                Cool. But when someone says “good morning” and you respond with “I don’t do small talk,” it’s not earning respect—it’s earning side-eyes and a possible HR complaint.</p>
            <p>
                "Comfort is the enemy of growth."
                Okay, Socrates. But also… You haven’t paid rent in 3 months because you “manifested financial abundance” instead of getting a job. Growth is great, but consider also growing your credit score.</p>
            <p>
                "I challenge the status quo."
                By refusing to use turn signals and calling it "living with intention"? Please. There’s a fine line between being revolutionary and just being annoying in traffic.</p>
            <p>
                🧠 A Little Self-Awareness Goes a Long Way

                Look, we all have our moments. We’ve all posted something dramatic after one therapy session and suddenly thought we were qualified to coach other people on “radical authenticity.”</p>
            <p>
                And hey, confidence is great. But when confidence gets so loud it drowns out common sense, that’s when it starts veering into cringe territory, especially when it’s paired with vague Instagram captions and a ring light.</p>
            <p>
                So, yes—be the captain of your ship. Just maybe make sure it’s floating. Or at least check if you’re steering it straight into a whirlpool of your delusions.</p>
